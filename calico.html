    <h1>Congratulations Tama!</h1>
    <div id="content-inner" class="peach_alpha rounded">
      <p class="peach column_count">In 2007, at Kishi Station, a small, often deserted train station in Japan, Tama (pictured) was hired as Station Master. Her official duties were to greet passengers; her salary, a station master's hat and food for the year. With the publicity surrounding her appointment, ridership increased, and the town benefitted with over a billion Yen flowing into the local economy.  In recognition of her hard work and contribution to the company, Tama has since been promoted; first to "Super Station Master" and she now holds the title of "Operating Officer".  She has her own office, a former ticket booth,  complete with a private litter box at the station. Not only is she the first female in a managerial position at the railroad, she also the first cat ever to hold an executive position at a railroad corporation! Along with her assistant Chibi, also a cat, Tama still greets passengers at the station. </p>

          <p>Tama is a Calico cat (mikeneko in Japanese). In Japan, among all the cats, mikeneko is considered to bring you the best of luck. Tama certainly proved this in Kishi!</p>
